# 📊 Bitcoin Sentiment vs Trader Behavior Analysis

This project explores how market sentiment (Fear or Greed) affects real trader behavior using data from Hyperliquid and the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index. It was built as part of a Data Science evaluation assignment.

---

## 🧠 Objective

To analyze how trading behavior (profitability, volume, risk exposure) aligns or diverges from overall market sentiment.

Key questions answered:
- Do traders take more risks during "Greed" days?
- Is profitability better when the market is fearful?
- How does total trade volume shift with sentiment?
